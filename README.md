## Workspace Setup

### Cloning the repository
- Run `git clone https://github.com/yyu2002/fudstops.git` in your desired directory.
- Run `npm install yarn` to install yarn as the package manager.

## Running the Application

### Starting the backend 
Before starting the frontend, run `yarn` in the `/backend` to install any missing dependencies. In the `/backend` directory run `yarn start` or `npm run start`

- The server should refresh and restart with new changes automatically if you make edits and save.

### Starting the front end
Before starting the frontend, run `yarn` in the `/frontend` to install any missing dependencies. In the `/frontend` directory run `yarn start` or `npm run start`. This runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

- The web page should reload automatically if you make edits and save.

### Running automated backend API endpoint tests
In the `/backend` directory run:
 - `yarn test` to run tests asynchronously
 - `yarn test --runInBand` to run them one by one

## Development

For more details on how to use yarn as a package manager, see the [yarn CLI documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/).

### Installing New Modules (Dependencies)
To install a new dependency required, navigate to either the frontend or backend directory, then run `yarn add <module_name>` to install the new module in its desired location. Make sure to not install dependencies in the project root directory, but rather in either the `/frontend` or `/backend` directories. If you accidentally ran installed a dependency in the root directory instead of in the `/backend` and `/frontend` directories, delete the `/node_modules` directory and yarn.lock files and make sure to run `yarn add ...` in the proper directory.

### Pushing New Changes
Before pushing any changes and making a pull request, run the following:
- `git config --global push.default current`: This will allow you to automatically push changes on your local branch to a remote branch of the same name using `git push` or `git push -u`. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1519006/how-do-i-create-a-remote-git-branch/27185855#27185855) stack overflow post for more details if interested.
- `git config --global pull.rebase true`: This will set git to default rebase when pulling.

Next, just run the following:
1. `git pull` to pull in any changes before committing. If the pull pull and rebase fails due to conflicting local changes run `git stash`, then `git pull`, then `git stash pop`. Fix any conflicts and commit when finished.
2. `git commit -m <message>` to commit your changes.
3. `git push` to push the changes to the remote branch that will be created by default based on the config set above.
4. Navigate to [Pull requests](https://github.com/yyu2002/Titan_Health_App/pulls) to create the pull request onto the `main` branch. Get the necessary approvals then merge and delete the branch.

<ins> Make sure not to push anything from `node_modules` when committing and pushing changes. We don't want tons of dependencies stored in our repository.<ins>

#### Pull Request Rules
The follow requirements must be met before pushing changes onto the `main` branch:
- Must be an invited contributor to the repository
- Must have 1 approval from another contributor
- Must have 1 approval from the repository owner (yyu2002)

### Personal Access Tokens
You may need to set up a personal access token for authentication due to GitHub's newer security guidelines. See [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) documentation for how to do so (create a classic token), or follow the steps below:
1. Go to the [Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in **Developer settings**.
2. Click on **Generate new token**, then **Generate new token (classic)**.
3. Give the token a name, set the desired expiration, and check every check box for maximum permission access, then at the bottom click **Generate token**.
4. Save the access token somewhere safe and local since you will need it to authenticate.

Next time if you are prompted for your username and password when pushing, use your access token as the password. If you don't want to retype your credentials every time, run `git config credential.helper store` before you run `git push`, and once you enter your credentials, they will be stored locally (unencrypted) so you don't have to re-enter them repeatedly.

### MongoDB Setup (For Database Access)
We have set up a MongoDB cluster though MongoDB Atlas, hosted on AWS. Follow the below steps to make sure you are setup for development. The necessary credentials are contained in the [credentials document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XyIoMjj3yVY9TDJR9R39AVFLrzpDo_KEBhMqWR9ADTs/edit) which is private (must request access).

#### Setting Up Network Access for your IP Address
1. Navigate to [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com/). Select the Titan Health App organization and project.
2. Under the `SECURITY` section on the left, go to `Quickstart`, and scroll down to `Add entries to your IP Access List`. Simply click `Add My Current IP Address`, and your device's IP will be granted access to the Database cluster. You can also add your IP in to the access list in the `Network Access` section but it's easier to do it through `Quickstart`.
